== Solving any Sudoku

This function can solve any Sudoku.

It uses an algorithm called depth first search.

[source,python,numbers]
----
def solve(b):
    if b is None or solved(b): return b

    s = empty_square(b)
    for d in possible_digits(b, s):
        solution = solve(assign(b, s, d))
        if solution: return solution

    return None

== The helper functions

+solve+ is defined in terms of these functions that we will need to implement.

[source,python]
----
def solved(b): ...

def empty_square(b): ...

def possible_digits(b, s): ...

def assign(b, s, d): ...
----

== But what data structures?

In order to implement those functions, we need to decide how to represent the Sudoku board.

There are lots of possibilities.
